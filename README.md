# AppOffline architecture

This repository is a demo app that implements the recomended Android App Architecture by Google, improved with Kotlin, RxJava instead of LiveData, and also Clean Architecture to add one layer (Iterators).

And as an excersise also I created a branch with Kotlin Coroutines implementation.
